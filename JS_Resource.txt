JAVASCRIPT:
INTRODUCTION:
	#]javscript is an interpreted programming language and as_well as a scripting language
	#]javascript is dynamicaly typed language (no need to specify the datatype of the value explicitly to be stored)
	#]javascript is case sensitive
interpreted : javascript engine uses interpreter for code conversion

uses of js:
	#] it is used to develop an interactive or dynamic web pages
	#] it is also used for basic client side validation(e.g email validation, debitcard validations, etc..)

JS Engine:
	each and every browser has js_engine
	Browser			JS_Engine
	1] chrome 	 	v8
	2]mozillaFirefox	spider Monkey
	3]ie 			chakra
	4]safari 		javascriptCore

libraries built by using javascript:
	block of optimal code used to perform a specific task 
	30 lines of jsCode and then i had wrapped it into a 3 lines of a single library to perform a task

	1] jQuery 2]loadAsh 3]bootstrap 4] _js  etc...

frameWork:
	collection of libraries
	1] NodeJs: server side programming
 2]ReactJS: one can develop any kind of web applications
 3]ReactNative: develop native mobile applications both in android and IOS
 5] ElectronJS: develop the standalone applucations e.g, calculater , notepad etc..
 6]tensorFlow: ml and ai
 7] AngularJS: single page applications e.g. google maps, gmail etc...

execution of javascript code:
	1] on browser:[ctrl+shift+i] ==> dev_tools tab
			* just open any browser and got to console panel and write js_code and execute it
			* you have to embed your js_code in html

			#how to embed the js_code inside the HTML
				1] inline embed :
					here we will make use of <script></script> tag
				2] external embed
					here we will make use of <script src="path of your .js file"></script> tag

	2] off browser:[NodeJS]   cmd promt node <file path>
		here we will make use of NodeJS

due to unavailability of autocompleteness and intellisense we go for IDE's
we will use vs code as an IDE

IDE ==> integrated development environment 

Tokens:
	the smallest part/unit of the code is called token

javascript tokens are classified into:
1]keywords:
	programmer defined words which had a predefined meaning in it e.g  if, for, while, do while
2]identifiers:
	user defined words user if going to set the value for those words or named memory block
		e.g. var a = 10; a identifier
	rule to use identifier:
		* it can be alfanumeric  var a2 = "hello"
		* it shouldn't start with numeric  2a = "15" ==> false
		* it can start with only special charectors "_" or  "$"   e.g. _a = 25; $a = "message";  viceversa
3]literals:
	the actual values that you are going to store in the memory / datatypes
4]operators: 
	used to perform opperations on oppeerands
	1] arithmatic operators[+, -, *, /, %]
	2] comparision/Relational operators[==(equal), ===(identical), >, <, <=, >=]
	3] bitwise[$, |, ~]
	4] logical[$$, ||, !]
	5] assignment operators[=, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=]
	6] special operators[type(), ternary(?:), in, instenseof, ....]
5]separetors :
	[(), {}, [], ;]

#]how to declare a veriable in javacsript:[var, let, const]
	var x; ===> declaration   let y = 10; const p = "global"
	x  = 5 ==> initialization
	log(x) ===> utilization

	var x = 5;  ===> declaration and initialization

# datatypes:
	* primitive datatype:
		String, number, boolean, undefined, null
	* non premitive/reference type datatype:
		objects, array, functions, 

 flow control statements[if, if else, if else if, switch] and looping statements[for, while, do while]

#]comparision operator
 ==(double equalsto)  ===> check  the value of operands
  ===(triple equalsto)   ====> checks for both value ans as well as datatype of the operands

#functions:  it's a block of code which performs a specific task, mainly developed for reuseability
we can write the functions in different ways:
	1]function declaration:
		syntax:
			function(keyword) name_of_the_function (parameters) {
				//statement block//
			}
			name_of_the_function(arguments)
	2]function expression
	3]immidiatly invokable functions[iif]
	4]Arrow function[es6 feature]

#array:
	array in js is used to store multiple values[heterogenious]

how to declare an array in js:
	1] var ar1 = new Array("value1", "value2", .......) //it is not recommended
	2] var arr2 = ["value1", "value2", .......]

To itrate over an array
1]for loop ===> returns the index of an array and doesn't ignores the empty element
2] for of loop ===> returns the element of an array and doesn't ignores the empty element
3] foreach()  method ===> return the element and index of the array and it ignores the empty element
4] for_in loop ==> returns the index of an array and  ignores the empty element

git from command line:

	git init ===>used to initialize an empty repo  (.git)
	git add <fileName>==> to add a specific file from unstaged area to a staged area
	git status ===> used to get the current status of the local repo
	git add .   ===> used to add all the files from unstagd area to staged area
	git rm --cached <fileName> ===> used to remove a specific file from staged area to unstaged area
	git commit -m "commit msg" ====> commitng/saving the changes in staged area
	git remote add <variableName> <url of rempote repo>===> used to assign the url of remote repo to a reference variable
	git push <url_of_global_repo> <branch_name> ===> used to push the code from local repo to global repo
	git branch ===> lists you the branches present in the repo
	git branch <branchName> ===> used to create a new branch in global repo
	git checkout <branchName> ===> used to switch control to specified branch
	git log====> log the commit history
	git config --list===> lists all the configurations of git in your local machine
	
#programm execution in memory:[variable hoisting/ function hoisting]
 * whenever you executed your javascript code, a global execution context(memory) will get created
 * inside the global context global object will get created by name "window"
 * along with window object global variable get created by name "this"
 * in the global levell object and variable are equal i.e, window == this
 * later it will create 2 phases 1] creation_phase 2] execution_phase
 * in creation phase separate memory will be created for the entire code 
	and by default undefined will be assigned as a value for the created memory
 * then in execution phase line by line execution occurs and actual value of the code will be assigned 
	to the memory by overriding the undefined value
	
#] callback functions:
	passing a function reference to other function and invocking the same inside the other function is called callback function
#] closure property:
	inner function still having an access on the variable that had been declared in outer funcction
	even after the execution of outer function

#] this keyword:
	the value of this keyword depends on the area where it has beed used or called
	this = window ====> in global levell
	this = object ====> in object levell

#] call(), bind(), apply():
	they are inbuilt methods which can  be used along with the functions using which we can set the value of this keyword

	call(obj_ref, optinalParams(separated by ,))==> it will accept object reference as a parameter and sets the value for this keyword and executes the function
		function barrowing:
				deriving the function from one object to other is called function barrowing
				function barrowing can be achived by call()

	bind(obj_ref, optinalParams(separated by ,))==>it will accept object reference as a parameter and it will create a separate copy of the function
							 sets the value for this keyword and returns the entire function
		function currying:
				it can be achived by bind() method, where we can pass the params in two different stages
	
	apply(obj_ref, array_of_params)===> working of apply() is similer to call() the only difference is it will accepts the params in the form of an array
	
# objects:
	any entity having states/properties and behaviors/values

To declare an object in javascript there are different ways:
1] object literal syntax
2] using new Object() keyword
3] using ibject.create() method
4] using constructor function
5] using class(es6 feature)
